### Documentation!
- [NixOS on DigitalOcean](/documentation/nixos-digitalocean)


**DrippiGG** is an organization and community focused on sharing developer tools for up-and-coming software developers, especially those looking to build their portfolios with "shipped titles." Our philosophy revolves around community, learning modern tools and technologies, and empowering developers to grow together.

## Our Core Beliefs

- **Community First**: We believe in the power of community and collaboration.
- **Learning by Doing**: We focus on creating tools that help developers learn by building real-world applications.
- **Cost-Effective Solutions**: We love using platforms like **DigitalOcean** because of its simplicity and cost-effectiveness.
- **Modern Tools & Technologies**: We emphasize using cutting-edge technologies like **Docker** and **Go**, especially when building and distributing game-related projects.
- **Open Source**: Our tools are open-source (MIT license) to encourage contributions and collaboration.

## What We Do

- **Developer Tools**: We create tools and frameworks for developers to help them build games, apps, and anything in between.
- **APIs**: Offering free and affordable APIs to help developers create robust projects with minimal overhead.
- **UI Component Libraries**: Building React UI component packages, particularly game-oriented ones.
- **Documentation**: We provide thorough documentation to make it easier for developers to get started and understand our tools. The documentation is located in the `/documentation` folder, and more resources will be added soon.

## Our Stack

- **DigitalOcean**: Cost-effective, simple cloud infrastructure that we use for hosting our services.
- **Docker**: We leverage Docker for containerization, which helps us build, ship, and run applications seamlessly.
- **Go**: Our backend and distribution tools are often powered by Go, due to its efficiency and speed, especially when dealing with game distribution.
- **GitHub**: We host our repositories and collaborate with the community through GitHub.
- **Discord**: Our community lives on Discord, where developers can chat, collaborate, and grow together. Join us [here - coming soon!]().

## Documentation

You can find our documentation in the `/documentation` folder. Currently, there’s a guide on **NixOS with DigitalOcean**, and we plan to add more in the future. Stay tuned!

## Community

DrippiGG is more than just a set of tools; it's a growing community of developers learning, sharing, and building together. We are constantly evolving and growing, with the ultimate goal of creating a robust ecosystem for developers to thrive.

## Our Plans

- **Create Tools**: Develop more tools that will help developers get started with their own projects.
- **Create Videos and Guides**: Produce video tutorials and resources to guide developers through the process of using our tools.
- **Contribute and Use**: Allow people to contribute to the project, create their own projects based on our tools, and use them freely under the MIT license.
- **Ship Games & Let's Make That $$$**: Build and release games, while potentially monetizing (games, APIs, etc.). The MIT license does not restrict you from selling software or making money, as long as you provide attribution and follow the license terms.

## License

DrippiGG tools are open-source and are licensed under the **MIT License**. This means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code, as long as you include the original copyright and license information in your distributions.

## Can I Make Money if It's MIT?

Yes! The MIT License allows you to use, modify, and distribute the software, even commercially. You can build upon our tools, use them in your own projects, and even sell the final product or service. Just ensure that the original license and copyright notice remain intact.
